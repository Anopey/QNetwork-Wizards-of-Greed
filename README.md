# QNetwork / Wizards of Greed

## Overview

This repository is actually two different projects: QNetwork and Wizards of Greed. The two projects support each other and depend upon one another so they have been placed in the same repository to make development easier.

**QNetwork** is a Unity multiplayer solution with dedicated multi-threaded GoLang servers. It is built from scratch using sockets.

**Wizards of Greed** is a multiplayer economics and top-down-shooter mix

Wizards of Greed depends upon QNetwork for its multiplayer functionality, whereas QNetwork uses Wizards of Greed for debugging, proof of concept, and finding out what features are necessary for a game-development workflow.
